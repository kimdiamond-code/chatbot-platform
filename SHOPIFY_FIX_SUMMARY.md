# Shopify API Route Fix - October 16, 2025

## Problem Identified
The Shopify integration wasn't connecting properly because:

1. **Two Different Storage Systems**: 
   - Old `UserShopifyService` was trying to use Supabase (which has been removed)
   - `shopifyService` loads from `integrations` table via consolidated API → **Neon Postgres**
   - These systems weren't synchronized

2. **Inconsistent Credential Format**:
   - Different services expected different credential formats (shopDomain vs shop vs store_url)
   - This caused credential lookup failures

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `shopifyService.js`
- **Enhanced credential loading** with multiple format support:
  - Handles `shopDomain`, `shop`, `store_url` variations
  - Handles `accessToken` vs `access_token` variations  
  - Cleans up domain names (removes `.myshopify.com` suffix)
- **Added better error handling** with detailed logs
- **Fixed order search** to use the correct `shopify_searchOrders` action

### 2. Updated `ShopifyIntegration.jsx`
- **Removed dependency** on old `UserShopifyService` (which used Supabase)
- **Now saves directly** to `integrations` table via consolidated API → **Neon Postgres**
- **Verifies credentials first** before saving
- **Proper credential format**:
  ```javascript
  {
    shopDomain: 'storename',  // without .myshopify.com
    accessToken: 'shpat_xxx',
    shopName: 'Shop Name',
    shopEmail: 'email@example.com',
    shopCurrency: 'USD'
  }
  ```

### 3. Consolidated API Already Had Support
- The `consolidated.js` API already had all necessary Shopify actions:
  - `shopify_verifyCredentials` - Test connection
  - `shopify_getProducts` - Fetch products
  - `shopify_getOrders` - Get customer orders
  - `shopify_searchOrders` - Find order by number
  - `shopify_getDraftOrders` - Get cart items
  - `shopify_createDraftOrder` - Create cart/draft order

## How It Works Now

### Connection Flow:
1. User enters Shopify credentials in Integrations UI
2. System verifies credentials with Shopify API
3. If valid, saves to `integrations` table with standardized format
4. Chatbot can now access via `shopifyService.getCredentials()`

### Data Flow:
```
ShopifyIntegration.jsx
  ↓
/api/consolidated (database endpoint)
  ↓
integrations table (Neon/Vercel Postgres)
  ↓
shopifyService.js
  ↓
Chat/Bot Features
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Connect Shopify Store:
- Go to Integrations page
- Click "Connect Shopify"
- Enter: 
  - Store name: `truecitrus2` (without .myshopify.com)
  - Access token: Your Shopify Admin API token
- Click "Connect Store"
- Should see success message

### 2. Verify Connection:
Open browser console and check for:
```
✅ Shopify credentials verified: {...}
✅ Shopify store connected successfully!
```

### 3. Test in Chat:
- Ask: "Show me products"
- Ask: "What's in my cart?" (with customer email)
- Ask: "Track order #1234"

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Neon Postgres connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For chat responses

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these changes: `vercel deploy --prod`
2. Test connection in production
3. Monitor console logs for any issues

## Files Changed
- `/src/services/integrations/shopifyService.js` - Enhanced credential handling
- `/src/components/integrations/ShopifyIntegration.jsx` - Unified to use consolidated API
- `/api/consolidated.js` - Already had all needed endpoints (no changes)

## Notes
- ⚠️ **Supabase has been completely removed** - the project now uses **Neon Postgres**
- The old `UserShopifyService` has been deprecated (renamed to .OLD)
- The `shopify_connections` Supabase table is no longer used
- All connections now go through `integrations` table in **Neon Postgres**
- This provides better multi-tenant support and consistency with the rest of the platform
