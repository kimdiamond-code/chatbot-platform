# FINAL SHOPIFY OAUTH FIX - Deploy This

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### 1. Removed React Hook Violations
- Removed all conditional returns before hooks
- Clean hook usage throughout

### 2. Proper Routing
- `AppRouter.jsx` handles `/shopify/callback` route
- Routes to `ShopifyCallback` component (which processes OAuth)
- Main `App` component handles all other routes

### 3. Clean Architecture
```
User clicks "Connect OAuth"
  ↓
Redirects to Shopify
  ↓
Shopify redirects to /shopify/callback?code=xxx&shop=xxx
  ↓
AppRouter detects /shopify/callback
  ↓
Renders ShopifyCallback component
  ↓
Component exchanges code for token
  ↓
Saves to database
  ↓
Redirects to /?shopify=connected
  ↓
App detects shopify=connected param
  ↓
Shows Integrations tab
  ↓
SUCCESS ✅
```

## 🚀 DEPLOY NOW:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

## ⚙️ After Deployment (CRITICAL):

### Update Vercel Environment Variables:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Project: **chatbot-platform-v2** → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
3. Update these:

```
SHOPIFY_SCOPES=read_customers,write_customers,write_customer_payment_methods,read_price_rules,read_discounts,write_draft_orders,read_draft_orders,read_inventory,read_locations,read_marketing_integrated_campaigns,read_marketing_events,read_orders,write_orders,read_product_listings,read_products,write_products,read_shipping,read_shopify_payments_accounts,customer_write_customers,customer_read_customers,customer_read_draft_orders,customer_read_orders,customer_write_orders

SHOPIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://chatbot-platform-v2.vercel.app/shopify/callback
```

4. Click **Save**
5. **Redeploy** (click Redeploy on latest deployment)

## 📋 Test With Dev Store:

1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Go to **Integrations** → **Shopify** → **OAuth tab**
3. Enter: `truecitrus2`
4. Click **"Connect with OAuth"**
5. Authorize on Shopify
6. Should redirect to /shopify/callback
7. Should process and redirect to /?shopify=connected
8. **Integration should show CONNECTED** ✅

## 🔧 For "Unauthorized" on Other Stores:

Your app is in **Draft** mode. To allow other stores:

### Enable Custom Distribution:

1. **Partner Dashboard** → **"Agentstack ai chat"** → **Distribution** tab
2. Click **"Custom distribution"**
3. You'll get an install link
4. Share this link with stores that want to install your chatbot
5. They click the link → Install → Can use OAuth

### OR Submit to App Store (for public access):

1. Complete app listing requirements
2. Submit for Shopify review
3. Once approved, any store can find and install your app

## 🎯 Expected Results After This Deploy:

✅ **Dev store**: OAuth connects and saves to database
✅ **No React errors**: Clean console
✅ **Other stores**: Still get "unauthorized" until you enable distribution (that's expected!)

## 📞 Next Steps:

1. Deploy ✅
2. Update Vercel env vars ✅
3. Test with dev store ✅
4. Enable distribution for multi-store access ✅
5. DONE! 🎉
