# Conversation Management & Shopify Detection Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ Conversation Management
- **Problem**: No way to delete or clear conversations
- **Solution**: Added full CRUD operations for conversations

### 2. ‚úÖ Shopify Detection
- **Problem**: Shopify showing as "Demo Mode" even after OAuth connection
- **Solution**: Added manual refresh button to re-check Shopify status

## Changes Made

### Backend API (`api/consolidated.js`)
Added two new database actions:

#### `delete_conversation`
- Deletes all messages for a conversation
- Deletes the conversation record
- Parameters: `conversationId`

#### `clear_all_conversations`
- Deletes all conversations for an organization
- Deletes all associated messages
- Parameters: `orgId`
- Returns count of deleted conversations

### Frontend Services

#### `src/services/databaseService.js`
Added methods:
- `deleteConversation(conversationId)` - Delete single conversation
- `clearAllConversations(orgId)` - Clear all conversations for org

#### `src/hooks/useConversations.js`
Added hooks:
- `deleteConversation` - Delete mutation with auto-refetch
- `clearAllConversations` - Clear all mutation with auto-refetch
- `deleting` - Loading state for delete operation
- `clearingAll` - Loading state for clear all operation

### UI Updates (`src/components/LiveChat.jsx`)

#### New Features Added:
1. **üóëÔ∏è Delete Button** on each conversation
   - Shows confirmation modal before deleting
   - Clears selection if deleted conversation was selected
   - Prevents accidental deletions with stopPropagation

2. **üóëÔ∏è Clear All Button** in header
   - Deletes ALL conversations for organization
   - Shows confirmation with count
   - Disabled when no conversations exist

3. **üîÑ Refresh Shopify Status Button**
   - Manually re-checks Shopify connection
   - Updates status indicator (Connected/Demo Mode)
   - Useful after connecting Shopify via OAuth

4. **Confirmation Modals**
   - Delete single conversation modal with customer name
   - Clear all conversations modal with count
   - Both show "cannot be undone" warning
   - Elegant design with proper spacing and colors

## UI/UX Improvements

### Conversation List
- Delete button appears next to status badge
- Delete button stops event propagation (doesn't select conversation)
- Shows customer name in confirmation modal
- Loading states during deletion

### Header Buttons
- New button layout with gap spacing
- Clear All button only enabled when conversations exist
- Proper aria-labels for accessibility
- Title tooltips on hover

### Shopify Status Indicator
- Refresh button in status box
- Works in both Connected and Demo Mode states
- Calls `integrationOrchestrator.refreshIntegrations()`
- Updates UI immediately after check

## Database Operations

### Delete Single Conversation
```sql
-- Delete messages first (foreign key constraint)
DELETE FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = ${conversationId}

-- Then delete conversation
DELETE FROM conversations WHERE id = ${conversationId}
```

### Clear All Conversations
```sql
-- Get all conversation IDs for org
SELECT id FROM conversations WHERE organization_id = ${orgId}

-- Delete all messages for these conversations
DELETE FROM messages WHERE conversation_id = ANY(${conversationIds})

-- Delete all conversations for org
DELETE FROM conversations WHERE organization_id = ${orgId}
```
