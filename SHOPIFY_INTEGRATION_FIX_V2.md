# 🛍️ Shopify Integration Fix V2
**Date:** October 12, 2025

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Shopify Connection Not Detected**
**Problem:** After completing OAuth, Shopify showed as "connected" in Integrations tab, but Live Chat still displayed "Demo Mode" and didn't load real products.

**Root Cause:** 
- The `shopifyService.getCredentials()` wasn't properly parsing the credentials from database
- The `integrationOrchestrator` wasn't logging detailed connection status
- The `enhancedBotService` wasn't refreshing after Shopify was connected
- LiveChat component always showed "Demo Mode" regardless of actual connection status

### 2. **Poor Error Handling**
**Problem:** When credentials were missing or malformed, the service failed silently without proper error messages.

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Enhanced Credential Parsing
**File:** `src/services/integrations/shopifyService.js`

**Changes:**
- Added try-catch for JSON parsing of credentials
- Added validation to ensure both `shopDomain` and `accessToken` exist
- Added detailed logging to show exactly what credentials are found
- Better handling of different credential formats (`shopDomain` vs `shop`, `accessToken` vs `access_token`)

```javascript
// Before
const credentials = typeof shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted === 'string' 
  ? JSON.parse(shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted)
  : shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted;

return {
  shopDomain: credentials.shopDomain || credentials.shop,
  accessToken: credentials.accessToken || credentials.access_token,
  connected: true
};

// After
let credentials;
try {
  credentials = typeof shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted === 'string' 
    ? JSON.parse(shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted)
    : shopifyIntegration.credentials_encrypted;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error parsing credentials:', error);
  return null;
}

const shopDomain = credentials.shopDomain || credentials.shop;
const accessToken = credentials.accessToken || credentials.access_token;

if (!shopDomain || !accessToken) {
  console.warn('Missing required Shopify credentials:', { shopDomain: !!shopDomain, accessToken: !!accessToken });
  return null;
}

console.log('✅ Shopify credentials found:', { shopDomain, hasToken: !!accessToken });
return {
  shopDomain,
  accessToken,
  connected: true
};
```

### Fix #2: Improved Integration Orchestrator
**File:** `src/services/chat/integrationOrchestrator.js`

**Changes:**
- Enhanced logging with emoji indicators for better visibility
- Added shop domain logging (without exposing sensitive data)
- Added `refreshIntegrations()` method to manually refresh connection status
- Better error handling for both Shopify and Kustomer checks

```javascript
// Before
console.log('✅ Shopify integration active (OAuth connected)');

// After
console.log('🔍 Checking Shopify integration...');
console.log('✅ Shopify integration active (OAuth connected)');
const credentials = await shopifyService.getCredentials();
if (credentials) {
  console.log('🏪 Shopify store:', credentials.shopDomain);
}
console.log('👥 Kustomer:', status.kustomer.connected ? '✅ connected' : '❌ disconnected');
```

### Fix #3: Enhanced Bot Service Refresh
**File:** `src/services/enhancedBotService.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `lastCheck` timestamp to track when integrations were last verified
- Added `refreshIntegrations()` method to manually re-check after connection
- Enhanced logging to show exact status of each integration
- Better formatting of status logs

```javascript
async refreshIntegrations() {
  console.log('🔄 Refreshing enhanced bot integrations...');
  await integrationOrchestrator.refreshIntegrations();
  await this.checkIntegrations();
  return this.getStatus();
}
```

### Fix #4: Auto-Refresh After Shopify Connection
**File:** `src/components/Integrations.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Made `handleShopifyConfigSaved` async
- Added automatic bot service refresh after successful Shopify connection
- Improved success message to inform user about the refresh
- Extended message display time to 10 seconds (was 5)

```javascript
const handleShopifyConfigSaved = async (configData) => {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // Refresh bot service to detect new Shopify connection
  try {
    const { enhancedBotService } = await import('../services/enhancedBotService');
    await enhancedBotService.refreshIntegrations();
    console.log('🔄 Bot service refreshed - Shopify integration active');
    
    setConnectionMessages(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      shopify: {
        type: 'success',
        message: '✅ Shopify store connected! Bot will now use real products. Refresh Live Chat to see changes.'
      }
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to refresh bot service:', error);
  }
};
```

### Fix #5: Dynamic Status Display in Live Chat
**File:** `src/components/LiveChat.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added real-time Shopify connection status checking
- Auto-refresh status every 30 seconds
- Three states: "checking", "connected", "demo"
- Updated all status indicators throughout the component:
  - Sidebar status box
  - Chat header badge
  - Empty state message

**Added State:**
```javascript
const [shopifyStatus, setShopifyStatus] = useState('checking')

useEffect(() => {
  const checkShopifyStatus = async () => {
    try {
      const { integrationOrchestrator } = await import('../services/chat/integrationOrchestrator')
      const status = integrationOrchestrator.getIntegrationStatus()
      setShopifyStatus(status.shopify.connected ? 'connected' : 'demo')
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to check Shopify status:', error)
      setShopifyStatus('demo')
    }
  }
  
  checkShopifyStatus()
  const interval = setInterval(checkShopifyStatus, 30000)
  return () => clearInterval(interval)
}, [])
```

**Updated UI Elements:**
- ✅ **Connected State**: Green badges showing "Shopify Connected" and "Using real products from your Shopify store"
- 🔄 **Checking State**: Gray badge with spinner showing "Checking Shopify..."
- 🎭 **Demo State**: Yellow badges showing "Demo Mode" and "Using mock data"

## 📊 Expected Console Logs After Fix

### When Shopify is Connected:
```
🔍 Checking Shopify integration...
✅ Shopify credentials found: { shopDomain: 'your-store.myshopify.com', hasToken: true }
✅ Shopify integration active (OAuth connected)
🏪 Shopify store: your-store.myshopify.com

3. Complete OAuth flow
4. Should see message: "✅ Shopify store connected! Bot will now use real products. Refresh Live Chat to see changes."

### 2. **Verify Connection in Live Chat**
1. Go to **Live Chat** page (or refresh if already open)
2. Check sidebar - should show **"✅ SHOPIFY CONNECTED"** (green box)
3. Check chat header - should show **"✅ Shopify Connected"** badge
4. If no conversations, empty state should show **"✅ Using Real Shopify Products"**

### 3. **Test Product Retrieval**
1. Create a conversation or select existing one
2. Type: "show me some products" or "I need headphones"
3. Bot should respond with **real products from your Shopify store**
4. Products should have actual images, prices, and descriptions

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Before This Fix:
- ❌ Shopify always showed as "Demo Mode" in Live Chat
- ❌ No way to tell if Shopify was actually connected
- ❌ Silent failures when credentials were missing
- ❌ Had to restart app to detect new Shopify connection

### After This Fix:
- ✅ Real-time Shopify connection status in Live Chat
- ✅ Auto-detects and refreshes when Shopify is connected
- ✅ Clear visual indicators (green = connected, yellow = demo)
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ No app restart needed - status updates automatically

## 🔄 Next Steps

After deploying, if Shopify still shows as demo:

1. **Check Database**
   - Verify integration is saved in `integrations` table
   - Check `status` column is 'connected'
   - Verify `credentials_encrypted` contains valid JSON

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for credential parsing errors
   - Check for missing `shopDomain` or `accessToken` warnings

3. **Manual Refresh**
   - In browser console, run:
     ```javascript
     import('../services/enhancedBotService').then(({enhancedBotService}) => {
       enhancedBotService.refreshIntegrations()
     })
     ```

4. **Hard Refresh**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cache
   - Should trigger fresh status check
