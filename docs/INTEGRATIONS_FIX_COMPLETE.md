# 🔗 Integrations Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
✅ **Integrations not showing up** - FIXED

## Root Cause
The App.jsx file was using a simple placeholder Integrations component instead of importing the full-featured one from `./components/Integrations.jsx`.

## Solution Applied
1. **Added proper import**: Added `import FullIntegrations from './components/Integrations.jsx';` 
2. **Replaced placeholder**: Changed the simple placeholder to use the full-featured component
3. **Verified components exist**: Confirmed individual integration components are available:
   - ShopifyIntegration.jsx
   - KustomerIntegration.jsx 
   - StripeIntegration.jsx
   - CalendarIntegration.jsx
   - EmailMarketingIntegration.jsx
