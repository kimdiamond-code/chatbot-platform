# 🧪 Operating Hours Bug Fix - Test Guide

## 🔍 **Testing the Fix: Bot Generic Hours Response Issue**

### **Problem Fixed:**
The bot was giving generic responses about operating hours instead of properly answering user questions.

### **Root Cause:**
Missing operating hours validation logic in API response flow.

---

## 🎯 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: During Operating Hours** ⏰
**Steps:**
1. Open Bot Builder → Custom Options tab
2. Set Operating Hours: `09:00 - 17:00 UTC` (or adjust for current time)
3. Ensure current time is WITHIN these hours
4. Test widget: `http://localhost:5173/widget/demo.html`

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Normal greeting message appears
- ✅ Ask "What are your return policies?" → Gets proper Q&A or AI response
- ✅ Ask "What are your hours?" → Gets operating hours info from Q&A
- ✅ NO generic hourly responses to unrelated questions

**Test Messages:**
```
"Hello" → Should get normal greeting
"I need help with my order" → Should get proper support response
"What's your refund policy?" → Should check Q&A database first
"Can you help me?" → Should get normal helpful response
```

### **Test 2: Outside Operating Hours** 🌙
**Steps:**
1. Open Bot Builder → Custom Options tab
2. Set Operating Hours: `09:00 - 17:00 UTC` (ensure current time is OUTSIDE)
3. OR temporarily set hours like `01:00 - 02:00` to force offline mode
4. Test widget

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Offline greeting message appears
- ✅ Any question → Gets "We're currently offline" message
- ✅ Shows operating hours info with next opening time
- ✅ Quick replies: "Leave a message", "Get notified when online", "View hours"

**Test Messages:**
```
"What are your return policies?" → Should get offline message
"I need help" → Should get offline message with hours info
"Hello" → Should get offline greeting with schedule
```

### **Test 3: Operating Hours Disabled** 🌐
**Steps:**

## 🐛 **If Issues Persist:**

### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Look for API errors in Console tab
3. Check Network tab for API call responses

### **Common Issues:**
- **API calls failing?** → Check if development server is running
- **Operating hours not working?** → Verify timezone settings in CustomOptions
- **Generic responses still appearing?** → Clear browser cache and reload

### **Debug API Responses:**
Check these endpoints in browser/Postman:
- `GET /api/bot-config` → Should return bot configuration
- `GET /api/operating-hours/status` → Should return current online status
- `POST /api/chat` → Should respect operating hours
