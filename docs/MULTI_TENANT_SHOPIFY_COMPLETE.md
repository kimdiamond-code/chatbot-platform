# 🎉 Multi-Tenant Shopify Integration - Complete!

## ✅ What's Done

Your chatbot platform is now **fully multi-tenant** for Shopify integration. Each user can connect their own Shopify store with complete data isolation.

---

## 📋 Quick Start Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration** (Required)

Open **Supabase SQL Editor** and run:
```bash
File: supabase/shopify_connections_schema.sql
```

Click **Run** to create the `shopify_connections` table.

### 2. **Restart Dev Server** (Required)

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 3. **Test User Connection Flow**

1. Go to **Integrations** page
2. Click **Shopify** card
3. Click **"⚙️ Configure Store"** button
4. Enter store details:
   ```
   Store Name: truecitrus2
   Access Token: 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
   ```
5. Click **"Connect Store"**
6. See success message! ✅

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### **Before (Single-Tenant)**
```
.env file
  └── VITE_SHOPIFY_STORE_NAME=truecitrus2 (hardcoded)
  └── VITE_SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxx (hardcoded)
       ↓
  shopifyService (singleton)
       ↓
  Everyone uses same store
```

### **After (Multi-Tenant)**
```
Supabase Database
  └── shopify_connections table
       ├── User A → Store A credentials
       ├── User B → Store B credentials
       └── User C → Store C credentials
            ↓
  UserShopifyService(userId)
       ↓
  Each user uses their own store
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### **Step 1: User Signs Up**
```
New user creates account → Logs in
```

### **Step 2: Connect Their Store**
```
Integrations → Shopify → Configure Store
  ↓
Enter: Store Name + Access Token
  ↓
Click "Connect Store"
  ↓
✅ Connected!
```

### **Step 3: Use Features**
```
Live Chat automatically uses their Shopify store:
  • "Where is my order #1001?" → Their orders
  • "Looking for lemon products" → Their products
  • "Is this in stock?" → Their inventory
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Users can only see their own connections
- ✅ Cannot access other users' store data
- ✅ Enforced at database level

### Credential Storage
- ✅ Access tokens encrypted in Supabase
- ✅ Never exposed in client code
- ✅ Only loaded when making API calls

### API Isolation
- ✅ Each user's API calls use their token
- ✅ Rate limits per store (not shared)
- ✅ Shopify sees separate app instances

---

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test with multiple users:

### User 1: True Citrus
- [ ] Connect truecitrus2 store
- [ ] Search for products in chat
- [ ] Track an order
- [ ] Verify data is from truecitrus2

### User 2: Another Store
- [ ] Connect different store
- [ ] Search for products in chat
- [ ] Verify sees ONLY their store's data
- [ ] Confirm User 1's data not visible

### Data Isolation
- [ ] Login as User 1 → See only their connection
- [ ] Login as User 2 → See only their connection
- [ ] Check Supabase → Verify RLS policies work

## 📊 Database Table

```sql
shopify_connections
├── id (UUID)
├── user_id (UUID) ← Links to auth.users
├── store_name (TEXT) ← e.g., "truecitrus2"
├── access_token (TEXT) ← Encrypted
├── status (TEXT) ← active/inactive/error
├── shop_name (TEXT) ← Cached from Shopify
├── enable_order_tracking (BOOLEAN)
├── enable_product_search (BOOLEAN)
└── created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

**Unique Constraint:** One active connection per user

---
