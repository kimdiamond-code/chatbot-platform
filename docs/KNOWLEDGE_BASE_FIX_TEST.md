# 🔧 Knowledge Base Bug Fix - Test Guide

## 🎯 **CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Bot Not Using Knowledge Base**

### **Problem:**
- Bot was giving random/generic responses instead of using uploaded knowledge base files
- When no suitable answer existed, bot gave random responses instead of honest "I don't know"

### **Solution:**
- ✅ Added proper knowledge base search to API fallback logic
- ✅ Enhanced search algorithm with keyword matching and snippet extraction
- ✅ Replaced generic responses with honest "I don't know" messages
- ✅ Added intelligent question detection for better response handling

## 🧪 **STEP-BY-STEP TESTING**

### **Step 1: Start the Platform**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\kdiamond\OneDrive - True Citrus\Directory\Chatbot\Chatbot set up\Chatbot-platform_files\chatbot-platform"
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Add Test Knowledge Base Content**
1. Open **http://localhost:5173**
2. Go to **Bot Builder** → **Knowledge Base** tab
3. Add a test document (or use the "Add Webpage" feature):

**Sample Test Content:**
```
Document Name: "Company Policies"
Content: "Our return policy allows customers to return items within 30 days of purchase. All returns must include original receipt and be in original packaging. We offer full refunds for defective items. Shipping policy includes free shipping on orders over $50. We ship within 2-3 business days. Customer service is available Monday through Friday from 9 AM to 5 PM."
Category: Support
Keywords: return, refund, shipping, policy, customer service
```

### **Step 3: Test Knowledge Base Responses**
Go to widget: **http://localhost:5173/widget/demo.html**

**Test Messages That SHOULD Find Answers:**
- "What is your return policy?" → Should get return policy from knowledge base
- "How long do I have to return items?" → Should match "30 days" info
- "Do you offer free shipping?" → Should find shipping info
- "What are your customer service hours?" → Should find hours info

**Expected Response Format:**
```
"Based on our documentation (Company Policies): Our return policy allows customers to return items within 30 days of purchase. All returns must include original receipt and be in original packaging..."

Source: 📚 knowledge_base
Confidence: 70-90%
```

### **Step 4: Test Honest "I Don't Know" Responses**
**Test Messages That SHOULD Get Honest Responses:**
- "What's your refund policy for international orders?" → No specific info, should be honest
- "Do you offer warranty on electronics?" → Not in knowledge base, should be honest
- "What's your price matching policy?" → Not covered, should admit it

**Expected Honest Response:**
```
"I don't have specific information about that topic in my current knowledge base. For accurate details, I'd recommend speaking with one of our human agents who can provide you with the most up-to-date information."

Source: honest_no_match
Should Escalate: Yes
```

### **Step 5: Test Clarification Requests**
**Test Vague Messages:**
- "Can you help me?" → Should ask for clarification
- "I have a question" → Should ask for more details
- "Hello there" → Should get normal greeting, not "I don't know"

**Expected Clarification Response:**
```
"I'm not sure I understand what you're looking for. Could you provide more details or rephrase your question? Alternatively, I can connect you with a human agent who might be better able to assist you."

Source: clarification_needed
Should Escalate: No
```

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **✅ Knowledge Base IS Working When:**
1. Questions about uploaded content get specific answers from documents
2. Responses mention "Based on our documentation/website"
3. Source shows `knowledge_base` or document name
4. Confidence levels are 60-90%

### **✅ Honest Fallback IS Working When:**
1. Specific questions about unknown topics get "I don't have information" responses
2. Bot admits it doesn't know instead of making up answers
3. Bot suggests speaking to human agents for unknown topics
4. No more random generic responses about hours for unrelated questions

### **✅ Flow IS Correct When:**
1. **First:** Checks Q&A Database
2. **Second:** Searches Knowledge Base  
3. **Third:** Returns honest "I don't know" response
4. **Never:** Returns random or irrelevant responses

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING CONSOLE LOGS**

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab to see:

```
🔍 Processing fallback for: What is your return policy?
📊 Available Q&A entries: 0
📚 Available knowledge base items: 1
🔍 Searching Q&A database...
📚 Searching knowledge base...
✅ Knowledge base match found
```

**Good Signs:**
- ✅ `Knowledge base match found`
- ✅ `Available knowledge base items: X` (where X > 0)
- ✅ `No matches found - returning honest response`

**Bad Signs:**
- ❌ `Available knowledge base items: 0` (knowledge base not loaded)
- ❌ No search logs appearing
- ❌ Generic fallback responses

---

## 📋 **TEST CHECKLIST**

### **Knowledge Base Search:**
- [ ] Added test document to knowledge base
- [ ] Questions about document content get relevant answers
- [ ] Responses cite the source document name
- [ ] Different keywords find same document
- [ ] Partial matches work (not just exact phrases)

### **Honest Fallback:**
- [ ] Questions about unknown topics get "I don't know" responses
- [ ] Bot admits lack of information instead of making up answers
- [ ] Suggests human agent for unknown specific questions
- [ ] No more random responses about hours/topics

### **Quality Control:**
- [ ] Normal greetings still work ("Hello" gets greeting, not "I don't know")
- [ ] Escalation keywords still trigger human handoff
- [ ] Operating hours logic still works
- [ ] Q&A database still takes priority over knowledge base

## 🚨 **COMMON ISSUES & FIXES**

### **Issue: "Available knowledge base items: 0"**
**Fix:** 
1. Go to Bot Builder → Knowledge Base
2. Add at least one document/webpage
3. Make sure it's enabled (toggle should be ON)
4. Refresh widget demo page

### **Issue: Still getting random responses**
**Fix:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Hard refresh widget page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Restart development server

### **Issue: Knowledge base not being searched**
**Fix:**
1. Check file content is not empty
2. Verify document is enabled
3. Make sure keywords include terms from your test questions

---

## 🎯 **VALIDATION SUMMARY**

✅ **BEFORE FIX:**
- Questions → Random responses about hours
- Unknown topics → Generic "I'm not sure" without explanation
- Knowledge base files → Ignored completely

✅ **AFTER FIX:**
- Questions → Search Q&A, then knowledge base, then honest fallback
- Unknown topics → "I don't have information about that"
- Knowledge base files → Actively searched and quoted
